<h1 align="center">Multi-Agent System for IIoT</h1>

<p align="justify">
agentMET4FOF is an implementation of a multi-agent system for agent-based 
analysis and processing of both static data sets and data streams with IIoT 
applications in mind. More on the motivation that drives the project can be found
in the section <a href="#about">About</a>.

## üí´Quickstart

agentMET4FOF comes bundled with some tutorials to get you started as quick as
possible. In your Python console execute the following to run the first tutorial.

```python
>>> from agentMET4FOF_tutorials.tutorial_1_generator_agent import demonstrate_generator_agent_use
>>> generator_agent_network = demonstrate_generator_agent_use()
```

```shell
Starting NameServer...
Broadcast server running on 0.0.0.0:9091
NS running on 127.0.0.1:3333 (127.0.0.1)
URI = PYRO:Pyro.NameServer@127.0.0.1:3333

## üí¨About

<p align="justify">
Sensor deployments in industrial applications usually form networks in all sorts of
environments. This requires a flexible framework for the implementation of the
corresponding data analysis. An excellent way to represent such networks is a
multi-agent system (MAS), where independent software modules (agents) encapsulate
properties and functionalities. agentMET4FOF is an interactive and flexible open-source
implementation of such a MAS. The software engineering process is driven by several
industry-oriented use cases with the aim of impacting on IIoT applications. This leads
to a framework that is specialized in representing heterogeneous sensor networks.
</p>
<p align="justify">
A special emphasize is put on supporting metrological treatment of sensor streaming
data. This includes the consideration of measurement uncertainties during data analysis
and processing as well as propagating metadata alongside the data itself.
</p>
<p align="justify">
One of the many questions that drive us in the project is:
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <cite>
  How can metrological input be incorporated into an agent-based system for addressing
  uncertainty of machine learning in future manufacturing?

## üìàThe agentMET4FOF dashboard

agentMET4FOF comes bundled with our so called _dashboard_. It is an optional component
of every agent network and provides a web browser based view. You can
observe the state of your agents, modify the connections between them and even add
more pre-made agents to your network all during run-time. The address to your
dashboard is printed to the console on every launch of an agent network.

The following image is close to what you will find in your browser on execution of
tutorial 2. For details on the tutorials visit our [video tutorial series](#video-tutorial-series).

## üìñDocumentation and video tutorials

Extended
[documentation can be found on ReadTheDocs](https://agentmet4fof.readthedocs.io).

### Video tutorial series

Additionally, we provide some [video tutorials based on agentMET4FOF 0.4.1 on the project homepage](https://www.ptb.de/empir2018/met4fof/information-communication/video-portal/)
in the section _Tutorials for the multi-agent system agentMET4FOF_. 
You can self-register on the linked page and get started immediately. The video series
begins with our motivation for creating agentMET4FOF, guide you through the
installation of Python and other recommended software until you execute the tutorials
on your machine.

### Live online tutorial during early development

In an early development stage we held a live online tutorial based on 
[agentMET4FOF 0.1.0](https://github.com/Met4FoF/agentMET4FOF/releases/0.1.0/) 
which you can [download](https://github.com/Met4FoF/agentMET4FOF/releases/download/0.1.0/Met4FoF.MAS.webinar.mp4).

If questions arise, or you feel something is missing, reach out to [us](https://github.com/Met4FoF/agentMET4FOF/graphs/contributors).

## üíªInstallation

The installation of agentMET4FOF is as straightforward as the Python 
ecosystem suggests. In the [video tutorials series](#video-tutorial-series)
we guide you through every step until you have agentMET4FOF running on 
your machine. Besides that we have more details in the [installation 
section of the docs](https://agentmet4fof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html).

## üí®Coming soon

- Dockerize agentMET4FOF
- Improve handling of metadata
- Further improve plotting

For a comprehensive overview of current development activities and upcoming tasks,
