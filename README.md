## 💬About

<p align="justify">
Sensor deployments in industrial applications usually form networks in all sorts of
environments. This requires a flexible framework for the implementation of the
corresponding data analysis. An excellent way to represent such networks is a
multi-agent system (MAS), where independent software modules (agents) encapsulate
properties and functionalities. agentMET4FOF is an interactive and flexible open-source
implementation of such a MAS. The software engineering process is driven by several
industry-oriented use cases with the aim of enabling IIoT applications. This leads
to a framework that is specialized in representing heterogeneous sensor networks.
</p>
<p align="justify">
A special emphasis is put on supporting metrological treatment of sensor streaming
data. This includes the consideration of measurement uncertainties during data analysis
and processing as well as propagating metadata alongside the data itself.
</p>
<p align="justify">
One of the many questions that drive us in the project is:
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <blockquote>
  How can metrological input be incorporated into an agent-based system for addressing
  uncertainty of machine learning in future manufacturing?
  </blockquote>

### Features

Some notable features of agentMET4FOF include : 

- Modular agent classes for metrological data streams and analytics 
- A built-in buffering mechanism to decouple transmission, processing and visualization
  of data
- Easy connection among software agents to send and receive data
- Choose backends between:
  - [_Osbrain_](https://osbrain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for simulating as well as 
    handling real distributed systems running Python connected via a TCP network, and 
  - [_Mesa_](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for local simulations of
    distributed systems, debugging and more high-performance execution
- Interactive and customisable dashboard from the get-go to:
  - Visualize and change agent-network topologies
  - Visualize groups of cooperative agents as _Coalitions_
  - View and change the agents' parameters
  - View the agents' outputs as plotly or matplotlib plots or generate and embed your 
    own images  
- Generic streams and agents that can be used as starting points in simulations
  - A sine generator with an associated agent
  - A generator for a sine signal with jitter dynamically or with fixed length
  - A white noise agent
  - A metrologically enabled sine generator agent which also handles measurement uncertainties

## 📈The agentMET4FOF dashboard

agentMET4FOF comes bundled with our so called _dashboard_. It is an optional component
of every agent network and provides a web browser based view. You can
observe the state of your agents, modify the connections between them and even add
more pre-made agents to your network all during run-time. The address to your
dashboard is printed to the console on every launch of an agent network.

The following image is close to what you will find in your browser on execution of
tutorial 2. For details on the tutorials visit our
[video tutorial series](#screencast-series).

You can self-register on the linked page and get started immediately. The video series
begins with our motivation for creating agentMET4FOF, guide you through the
installation of Python and other recommended software until you execute the tutorials
on your machine.

### Live online tutorial during early development

In an early development stage we held a live online tutorial based on 
[agentMET4FOF 0.1.0](https://github.com/Met4FoF/agentMET4FOF/releases/0.1.0/) 
which you can [download](https://github.com/Met4FoF/agentMET4FOF/releases/download/0.1.0/Met4FoF.MAS.webinar.mp4).

If questions arise, or you feel something is missing, reach out to
[us](https://github.com/Met4FoF/agentMET4FOF/graphs/contributors).

## 💻Installation

There are different ways to run agentMET4FOF. Either:

1. you [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and our package
   [agentMET4FOF](https://pypi.org/project/agentMET4FOF/) in a virtual Python 
   environment on your computer, or
2. you [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [start agentMET4FOF in 
   a container](https://agentmet4fof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html#start-a-container-from-the-image)
   and [visit the Jupyter Notebook server and the agentMET4FOF dashboard directly in 
   your browser](https://agentmet4fof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html#start-a-container-from-the-image-for-local-use)
   or even [deploy it over a proper webserver](https://agentmet4fof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html#deploy-the-containerized-agents-via-a-webserver).

In the [video tutorials series](#screencast-series)
we guide you through every step of option 1. More detailed instructions on both 
options you can find in the [installation 
section of the docs](https://agentmet4fof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html).
