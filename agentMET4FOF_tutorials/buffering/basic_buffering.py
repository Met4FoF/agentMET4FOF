#In real-time sensor network applications, the ability to store data incrementally is a necessity.
#With the built-in buffering mechanism in the agents, we can send a data from an agent acting as a source,
#to another agent acting as temporary storage.
#Every agent's buffer can be accessed via agent.buffer, which is an AgentBuffer object.
#This mechanism is used implicitly by the MonitorAgent, for example, to store the data incrementally and plot them on the Dashboard.
#In this tutorial, we show how to set the buffer's size, update and read its content.
#We show how we can read a single data from a sine generator, and store it in the agent buffer.
#When the buffer is filled up (set buffer_size to 5 entries), we send out the buffer content to the MonitorAgent, and empty the buffer to receive new data.
